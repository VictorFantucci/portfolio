## SUMMARY
I am a data specialist with over 2 years of hands-on experience in Python, SQL, and machine learning (ML) algorithms, working on end-to-end data projects. I have extensive experience in creating Data Science and ML products using tools like Scikit-Learn, as well as working with Artificial Intelligence. My expertise includes both relational and non-relational databases (MySQL and MongoDB), data analysis, and visualization through dashboards in Power BI and Streamlit. I have developed and deployed ML models in production using Docker and APIs, in addition to leading full ETL processes. A notable example of my work is the development of a KPI control tool for Tenaris Confab, which helped leadership make data-driven strategic decisions. I am eager to develop as a data scientist specializing in optimization and plan to pursue a master's degree in graph theory after completing my MBA. With a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and an MBA in Data Science and Analytics, I can deliver innovative solutions both in collaboration with teams or independently.
